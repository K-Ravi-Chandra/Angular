Except for arrow functions, they will be kept in stack only after calling the function

But for arrow functions, just after declaration , they are sent to the stack
So better performance (already loaded....)
=> Only most frequently used functions are stored in stacks  (storage issue, to boost performance)



// Browser will understand only js 
So typescript need to be transpiled to js 

// ngclient will help to convert ts to js
// If you dont have ngclient and want to work in ts, we use (ts compiler) npm-node package manager....
